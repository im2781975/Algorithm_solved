//Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

    // Initialize dp[0] to 0, since it takes 0 perfect squares to sum to 0.
    dp[0] = 0;
